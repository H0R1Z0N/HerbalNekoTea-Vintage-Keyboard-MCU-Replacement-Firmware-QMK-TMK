Due to Teensy 2.0++ being discontinued and impossible to find anymore at low price
and due to Pro Micro having the same fate soon following in the coming month.
This should be the best replacement for any MCU for keyboard in January 2023.

-New Pro Micro clone from China (ATMega32U4) : ~$8 CAD for 18+2 i/o pins Micro/C
-STM32F401CCU6 STM32F411CEU6 : $6 or $10 CAD for 34 i/o all 5v resistant (2 clock speed option) Type-C
-STM32F407VGT6 STM32F407VET6 STM32F407ZGT6 : $12 USD for a massive 140 i/o pins, perfect for something crazy with RGB LED
-Raspberry Pi 2040 Pico Clone Lite Black/Purple : 28/30/31 pins variant, be sure to pick up what you need. $2.60 for them
-Raspberry Pi 2040 Zero : $3.50 for official one, 24+1 i/o pins
-Raspberry Pi 2040 One : $6 for 20 easy access one, 8 harder to get, 1 extra for LED, very compact for easy internal mod to use with usb extension.



Meh :
-STM32F103C8T6 : 27 i/o pins ? Support RTC/Timers too, but 14 pins are 3.3v only but it's less than $5 ship
-STM32F103C6T6 : 27 i/o pins ? Support RTC/Timers too, same than one above but less timer and serial... meh.
-CH32F103C8T6 : Chinese clone half price of the one above

Bluetooth module ?

STM8S003F3P6 STM8S003F3U6 : $2.20 USD Bluetooth module with antenna.


=====> The best option's the STM32F401CCU6 for how cheap it's and how practical it's with higher reliability probably
