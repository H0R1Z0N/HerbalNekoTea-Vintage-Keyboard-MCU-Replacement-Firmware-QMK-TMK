The other line go from the top side of the pcb toward the same left sn74ls251n, the right one using in-line resistor, so it mean that the row or col being seperated or go to that sn74ls156...

Not only are those chip fucking tiny as fuck... they are gonna be painful to jumper wired... it's better to desolder the ribbon cable on main pcb and use that instead to remove the useless og controller which can be resold for part to pc collector moron.
