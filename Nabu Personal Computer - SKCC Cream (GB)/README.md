-Step 0, optional, but flash firmware on STM32F401 to be sure it work fine, short pins on controller to see if any keys are outputted in a text field like discord.
-Step 1, remove glue behind main alps pcb (Googone + knife)
-Step 2, rinse the googone and dry the pcb with air compressor
-Step 3, desolder ribbon cable on alps pcb
-Step 4, be sure to desolder bread to see the hole on pcb where the controller was
-Step 5, nail polish on alps pcb north of the ribbon cable hole to protect in case (optional)
-Step 6, solder arduino 90Â° angled socket
-Step 7, clean the flux with alcohol
-Step 8, connect dupont female to female cable, have them being 10cm minimium for enough lenght, 15cm to 20cm recommended.
-Step 9, solder the arduino socket to the STM32F401
-Step 10, screw the bracket printed to the screw hole in the center
-Step 11, dock the ardunio inside the socket, secure it
-Step 12, epoxy or nail polish the STM32F401 USB-C Socket to add resistance against tearing of the socket
-Step 13, connect female lead to the stm32F401 socket
-Step 14, flash final firmware you want on the controller.
-Step 15, brag about Nabu being USB and working
